Usage: ./philosophers [number_of_philosophers] [time_until_death] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] {number_of_rounds}

Every philosopher should have enought time to eat and sleep, so death should be higher than both of them. 
The number of rounds is optional, it can work with or without, it'll just stop when each philosopher has eaten {number_of_rounds} times.
